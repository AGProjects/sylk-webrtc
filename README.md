# Sylk

Sylk is a WebRTC client focused on multiparty video conferencing.  Sylk is
the companion client for SylkServer video conferencing application.

Sylk is built using HTML and JavaScript and uses the
[SylkRTC](https://github.com/AGProjects/sylkrtc.js) API to talk to
SylkServer.  It can be served as a web page using the web server of your
choice, or it can be packaged as a stand alone desktop application using
Electron.  This repository contains the code to build the website and a
companion [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) app.

## Features

* Audio / video calling with SIP interoperability
* Multi-party video conferencing (WebRTC only)
* Guest mode (no account required if invited)

## Customization

The default settings of the app are found in src/app/config.js

## Development

Nodejs is needed for development.  Version >= 8.0 is recommended.  A
convenience `configure` script and `Makefile` are provided.

Nodejs can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org

yarn must be used to install dependencies, it can be installed as
follows:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

NOTE: depending on your Node installation you might need to use `sudo`.

* Install all dependencies

```
    ./configure
```

For Windows build:

```
    brew cask install xquartz
    brew install wine
```


### Website

* Build the ready to be deployed distribution (available in dist/)

```
    make
```

* Development build, starts a test webserver which auto-reloads as the code changes

```
    make watch
```

* Deploy the built website to the server

```
    make deploy
```

* Deploy the built website to the staging server

```
    make deploy-test
```

### Electron application

The version number is set in app/package.json

* Build the Electron application

```
    make electron
```

* Build and run Electron application:

```
    make app-run
```

* Build macOS DMG package

```
    make pkg-osx
```

* Build Windows NSIS based installer (universal: 32 and 64 bits)

```
    make pkg-win
```

NOTE: If building on macOS Wine must be installed with `brew install wine`.

* Build Linux AppImage (both 32 and 64 bit builds)

```
    make pkg-linux
```

NOTE: Requires a GNU/Linux system with the following packages installed: icnsutils, graphicsmagick


### Common

* Clean the distribution

```
    make clean
```

* Clean all installed packages and generated files

```
    make distclean
```

## Debugging

By default Sylk doesn't output a lot of information to the browser's JavaScript console.
Console debug messages are namespaced by library, the two most important ones being 'sylkrtc' and 'blinkrtc'.
In order to enable debugging for both open the browser's JavaScript console and type the following:

```
    window.blinkDebugger.enable('sylkrtc*,blinkrtc*');
```

Then reload the page. Debug messages will be logged to the console now.
